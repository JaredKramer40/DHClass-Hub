DHClass-Hub
===========

Welcome to the Pitt-Greensburg DH Class Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/">http://newtfire.org/dh/</a>.
* Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer. Here's <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">a desktop client</a> to help make that happen.  

* In order for you to participate in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and <mailto:ebb8@pitt.edu>write me</mailto> to tell me how to find you. 

* Then we can experiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space.

* Now, try to "sync" your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository.
