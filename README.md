DHClass-Hub
===========

Welcome to the Pitt-Greensburg DH Class Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/">http://newtfire.org/dh/</a>.
* Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer. Here's <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">a desktop client</a> to help make that happen.  

* In order for you to participate in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write to me to tell me how to find you. 

* Then we can experiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first <strong>commit</strong> your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must <strong>sync</strong> in order to push these to the GitHub cloud. 

* Always be sure to <strong>"sync"</strong> your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. Always sync your local directory with our class directory 1) when you begin work, and 2) when you concluding work at a local computer.
