===========

Welcome to the DH Class Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment.
* Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer. 

* If you'd like to experiment with collaboration in this space, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write me to tell me how to find you. 

* Then we can experiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use yout GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space.

* Now, try to "sync" your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository.
