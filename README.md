DHClass-Hub
===========

Welcome to the Pitt-Greensburg DH Class Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <a href="http://newtfire.org/dh/">http://newtfire.org/dh/</a>.

* Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer. 
* Read and follow the instructions here to get started with GitHub: <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/github.xhtml">http://dh.obdurodon.org/github.xhtml</a>

* In order for you to participate in this shared class space, to add files, open issues, and join the discussions here, I need to add you as a collaborator. Set up your own GitHub account and write to me to tell me how to find you. 

* We recommend installing a free desktop client for convenient use of GitHub as a repository to manage shared class and project files: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a>. The desktop client helps you with synchronizing local Github directories on your computer(s) with the central repository in the GitHub cloud.

* When you have set up an account and have a desktop client to work with, you are ready to nexperiment with pushing (or committing) new files to this repository. Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first <strong>commit</strong> your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must <strong>sync</strong> in order to push these to the GitHub cloud. 

* Always be sure to <strong>"sync"</strong> your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. Always sync your local directory with our class directory 1) when you begin work, and 2) when you conclude work at a local computer.
