<paragraph>We will get tickets for some entertainment (I can't be certain which)
on <date when="1926-05-25">Tuesday</date>, So come, and it will be great fun. You'll find me here anytime
after <time>six</time>. But I'm afraid I chattered too much <date when="1926-05-21">yesterday</date>, and meaning to
let you in, <persName>Leonard</persName> did, which saddened me.
But to business. You said you were going to finish a book in <placeName>Persia</placeName>.
Would you let us have it? The point is I don't want to press you, if you
feel, as you may, that Heinemann's has a right, and is, as maybe too, more
profitable. At the same time I dont want these refinements of feeling to
lose us a chance which would give a great fillip to our autumn season. So
consider.</paragraph>
<paragraph>I did enjoy seeing you, and am wearing your necklace, and my exuber-
ance after all is not my egotism, but your seduction. Is your garden good?</paragraph>

Excuse this handwritingâ€”we are going to watch <event type="sport">cricket</event> at <persName>Lord</persName>s and I
must wash.</closingLine></root>
