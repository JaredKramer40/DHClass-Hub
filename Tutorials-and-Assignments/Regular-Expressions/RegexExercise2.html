      <p>Your challenge is to up-convert to XML the complete plain text file of <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete-regex2.txt"><i>A VOYAGE round the WORLD</i> by Georg
            						Forster</a>. This file is quite large, so autotagging using Regular Expressions
         			(regex) is really the only option we have to make this text into an XML document.
         Begin by downlading the text file and opening it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Use the Find/Replace
         window to autotag the document, and review our <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ebb8/DHDS/explainRegex.html">Guide to Autotagging with Regular Expressions</a> as you work. Your XML markup should accomplish the following:
      </p>
      		
      <ol>
         <li>Indicate the structure of the file by marking Book divisions, chapter divisions, and
            paragraphs.
         </li>
         						
         <li>Tag the dates, at least the dates that sitting in square brackets. Ideally, you should
            remove any pseudo-markup around them.
         </li>
      </ol>
      		
      <p>Your complete text should look like <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete-regex2-xml.xml">our model XML file</a>, only you could go one better by removing the pseudo-markup (the brackets) around
         the dates. Can you locate and tag more dates than those in the square brackets? 
      </p>
      			
      <ul>
         				
         
         			  
         <li><strong>Record each step of your process carefully</strong>, in a separate document (ideally a plain text file), since this is the
            			    file we will be grading. These will include global Find-and-Replace
            			    operations or Regular Expressions in oXygen (using Ctrl-F on Windows
            			    or command-F on Mac). Your goal is to produce an XML document like our model,
            but even if you have have trouble, what's most
            			    important is that you document the steps you took.

         <li><strong>Upload two files on Courseweb for this exercise:</strong> 
            			  	
            			  
            <ol>	
               <li>the document in which you recorded your
                  			    steps (either a text file or a Word document, whichever is
                  			    convenient), 
               </li>
               			 
               <li>your end result XML file.</li>
            </ol>
            			  
         </li>
