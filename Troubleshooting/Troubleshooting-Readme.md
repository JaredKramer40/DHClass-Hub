Welcome! We're glad you're here. Post code here that is causing you difficulties, where you need some help. 

* Save a file or a sample file that helps to highlight the problem here in the Troubleshooting directory, and push it to the cloud for us to look at together. 

* Always describe the problem you are having in "Issues" using the "help wanted" label and choosing the appropriate milestone. You may also describe the problem in your Commit message, but
Issues will give you more space to work with, and will be more easy for us to find and archive. Use the "open" and "close" features in Issues to keep track of your issue and
whether it was resolved.

* We can then respond to your comments in "Issues" and add specific commentary to lines of your file to help you debug your code* When in doubt, post your code here and write up an Issue! Don't be shy or anxious about this: Others may be having similar problems, and the best way to resolve them sometimes is if we look at the files all together! That's how coders work--we're here for each other. :-)
