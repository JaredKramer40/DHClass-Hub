        <greeting>Dear <person nameRef="eWest" occupation="writer">Eddy</person>,</greeting>
        <body>
            I am awfully sorry, having just said I would go on <day when="18-05-1926" dayOfTheWeek="Tuesday">Tuesday</day>. Now I
            am overcome by the feeling that I can'tâ€”the truth is I am all over the place
            trying to do a difficult thing in my novel [the <literaryWork type="sectionOfNovel" nameRef="">Time Passes</literaryWork> section], also I
            was chattering horrible nonsense all <day when="14-05-1926" dayOfTheWeek="Friday" timeOfDay="night">last night</day>, and feel positive I should
            wreck your evening. This is not a pose; I would much rather you came and
            saw me, say <plannedActivity when="19-05-1926">tea</plannedActivity>, on <day when="19-05-1926" dayOfTheWeek="Wednesday">Wednesday</day>; and got somebody else to go to the <plannedActivity when="18-05-1926">concert</plannedActivity>.
            Please forgive me; but you will understand the horror that comes over
            one of ones self and being engaged and making a mess of things.
        </body>
