        <!-- ghb 2015-09-10: Uh oh! You closed your paragraph element before adding your attribute! Also, white-space inside an attribute means "and", so use camelCase
            or an underscore to join together multiple words like this : nortonMass or Norton_Mass. Usually, other punctuation is not necessary indide an attribute, either. 
        Alternatively you could carry the city and state in two separate attributes: city="Norton" state="Mass".

        NORTON, Mass. -- If golf is a fickle thing then you should see what the rankings
        for the No. 1 player in the world have been like lately. </p>

        Take the back-and-forth between Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth.</p>

        Spieth didn't get anything going for the second week in a row and missed the cut at the 
        Deutsche Bank Championship by 2 strokes. McIlroy played poorly, but at least was still 
        playing on Labor Day at TPC Boston.</p>
    
    <p sentence="1"><name list="Rory_McIlroy Jordan_Speith">2</name>
        Even without Spieth playing the final two rounds and McIlroy finishing with a 5-under 66 to get to
        3-under for the four days, it is Spieth who will be ranked No. 1 in the world because McIlroy couldn't 
        leapfrog basically an entire field of golfers yesterday.</p>

        If you think that's strange, just think about how McIlroy reclaimed the No. 1 ranking before the week 
        started. He sat out The Barclays and Spieth played poorly, missing the first cut of the FedEx Cup
        playoffs. The world golf rankings are based on a two-year rolling period.</p>

        "I don't see any other way," McIlroy said. "You can do it on a one-year point system. I think two
        years is a reflection of how you played. At the end of the day it's just about playing and playing well.
        I don't know any way we could determine the best player in the world if you go on majors or number of 
        wins in the season."</p>

        McIlroy showed signs that he might be coming out of his slow return from an ankle injury. He said
        he's not too focused on the No. 1 ranking, focusing more on just playing well the rest of the way
        in the FedEx Cup playoffs. </p>
    
    <p sentence="2"><name list="Rory McIlroy">1</name>
        "I'd love to play well next week and get myself into the top five going into Atlanta," McIlroy said.
        "That's still the goal."</p>

<!-- ghb ebb 2015-09-10: Check Minus. We see you've selected a complex document for this, and we like that you have applied your markup to code information about speakers and events. 
    But there are some problems here, as noted in the comments above! You had some difficulty with formatting yout attributes by including excessive
    white-space and punctuation, and sevearl of your attributes are hanging outside of the element tags and are actually in the text node, which means they WILL NOT BE PARSED (or READ) by the computer as 
    attributes. (We notice this has been an error in previous assignments, and we know you've corrected it in the past, so we're surprised to still see the error here.
    Finally, in a document like this, it is useful to group related elements together in a "head" and "body" element, for example, just inside the 
    "root" element. We encourage you to revise and resubmit this assignment to perfect your understanding of these concepts. -->
