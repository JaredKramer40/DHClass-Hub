# ebb: 2015-09-13: Ryan: I've taken the liberty of correcting your code so the schema is green, 
# and I just saved this with a different file name. Notice that rules for attributes only contain one thing, 
# and that can either be text or a data type like a number (xsd:int). You might want to use xsd:int for the
# attributes that contain numerical values, in fact. We made your syntax right, but when we associate this
# schema with your XML, there are lots and lots of validation errors, and that's because you have more 
# work to do to define rules for more elements and attributes. Sync your GitHub so you can access the files 
# locally on your computer, and keep on going on this schema file: 
# See if you can finish writing all the rules you need for your XML to be valid.
