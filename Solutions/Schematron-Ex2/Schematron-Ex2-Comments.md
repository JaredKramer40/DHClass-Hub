## About the Files Posted Here

We posted the article XML file and its associated Relax-NG schema (with its .rnc extension) given us by Obdurodon. We have also posted two solution files, one correct and one incorrect:

* SchEx2-ebb-Solution.sch is our solution that works to constrain the lengths of the articles that follow the original article. 

* SchEx2-ebb-Wrong.sch shows an answer that doesn't work.

As you review this exercise, we'd like you to open these files in oXygen and spend time with each file and our posted comments to be sure you understand why one version works and the other does not!
