<l>In Xanadu did Kubla Khan</l>
<l>A stately pleasure-dome decree:</l>
<l>Where Alph, the sacred river, ran</l>
<l>Through caverns measureless to man</l>
<l>Down to a sunless sea.</l>

<l>So twice five miles of fertile ground</l>
<l>With walls and towers were girdled round:</l>
<l>And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,</l>
<l>Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;</l>
<l>And here were forests ancient as the hills,</l>
<l>Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.</l>

<l>But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted</l>
<l>Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!</l>
<l>A savage place! as holy and enchanted</l>
<l>As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted</l>
<l>By woman wailing for her demon-lover!</l>
<l>And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,</l>
<l>As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,</l>
<l>A mighty fountain momently was forced:</l>
<l>Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst</l>
<l>Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,</l>
<l>Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:</l>
<l>And 'mid these dancing rocks at once and ever</l>
<l>It flung up momently the sacred river.</l>
<l>Five miles meandering with a mazy motion</l>
<l>Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,</l>
<l>Then reached the caverns measureless to man,</l>
<l>And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:</l>
<l>And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far</l>
<l>Ancestral voices prophesying war!</l>

<l>The shadow of the dome of pleasure</l>
<l>Floated midway on the waves;</l>
<l>Where was heard the mingled measure</l>
<l>From the fountain and the caves.</l>
<l>It was a miracle of rare device,</l>
<l>A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!</l>

<l>A damsel with a dulcimer</l>
<l>In a vision once I saw:</l>
<l>It was an Abyssinian maid,</l>
<l>And on her dulcimer she played,</l>
<l>Singing of Mount Abora.</l>
<l>Could I revive within me</l>
<l>Her symphony and song,</l>
<l>To such a deep delight 'twould win me</l>
<l>That with music loud and long</l>
<l>I would build that dome in air,</l>
<l>That sunny dome! those caves of ice!</l>
<l>And all who heard should see them there,</l>
<l>And all should cry, Beware! Beware!</l>
<l>His flashing eyes, his floating hair!</l>
<l>Weave a circle round him thrice,</l>
<l>And close your eyes with holy dread,</l>
<l>For he on honey-dew hath fed</l>
<l>And drunk the milk of Paradise.</l>
