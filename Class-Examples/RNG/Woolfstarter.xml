      When I moved <date>, I needed to make sure that it is understood to be an element inside <head>, and not <address> over in my schema.

            still come to the basement at 12.30 and have a preliminary talk (must it be about the
            Polish rebellion?) with me in my studio—then 6 or 7 hours upstairs. (unless you'll dine
