        <p n="1">Yes, yes, yes. Come at once.</p>
        <p n="2">Everybody is longing to see you. Grizzle in paroxysms. Lunch at 1. Friday. Better still
            come to the basement at 12.30 and have a preliminary talk (must it be about the Polish
            rebellion?) with me in my studio—then 6 or 7 hours upstairs. (unless you'll dine with me
            on <date when="1926-05-20">Thursday</date>, when I happen to be alone)</p>
        <p n="3">Ah-hah! Revolutions—Poland—enquiries—scrapes—what fun it'll be.</p>
